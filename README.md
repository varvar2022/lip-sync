## Three Major Pain Points of Traditional Lip Sync Technology

Traditional lip sync methods have long faced three fundamental limitations. First, **local audio perception** only focuses on phoneme matching, completely ignoring the rich emotional and tonal information in audio, resulting in stiff and unnatural mouth movements. Second, **temporal inconsistency** frequently causes animation drift and expression jumps when processing long audio, disrupting the coherence of natural speech. Finally, **monotonous expression issues** rely on visual driving or simple phoneme mapping, unable to capture genuine expression intent from audio signals.

## Global Audio Perception Technology Breakthrough

Revolutionary Global Audio Perception technology treats audio as an "ideal and unique prior" to drive animation generation. Unlike traditional methods, this technology analyzes audio in both intra-segment and inter-segment dimensions, deeply understanding tone, rhythm, and emotion to generate organically coordinated facial animations.

This technology not only synchronizes lip movements but also infers complete expression intent from audio, generating natural head poses and facial expressions. The system employs lightweight Whisper-Tiny models across multiple time resolutions to extract rich audio embeddings, capturing long-term temporal audio knowledge for contextually aware generation.
